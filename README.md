# A Decentralised Ontological Organisation for GastroNauts
Creative Convergence of Chefs and Coders for the Culinary Community of GastroNauts

## Inspiration
- AAHAARA Apps from Semiott Society
- A Soft Fork of EddieNet
- An implementation of Ruchi Gramam
- Culinary Communitites in Kundara, Kollam, Kerala

## What it does
- Creates an Ethereum Ecosystem Experience powered by the concept of Interactive and Innovative Non Fungible Tokens. 
- Tokenisises the food recipes, food streets, food sharing events, food blogs, food festivals and related social businesses.
- Creates an enthusiastic and exciting future for dynamic decentralization of culinary cultures and cuisines across the world. 
- Embarks on a creative convergence of food makers, lovers and consumers beyond the walls of accumulations and aggregations.  
- Food Events, Festivals, Carnivals, Blogs, etc will be streamed through the ERC 1620 Streaming Token Specification. 

## How we built it
- The Food Streets are captured on Videos and added to the IPFS. The Food Recipes are also added to IPFS. 
- All these food related artifacts are minted into Non Fungible Tokens using the Minty Framework integrated to the IPFS. 
- The profits from the Food Experiences are converted to Food Fungible ERC 20 tokens 
- The Incentives generated from the Food NFT interactions are distributed through a Curve Contract powered by Bancor Formula. 
- Food recipes and food experiences they are delivered through the Zether Framework implementation of ERC 1724 specification. 
- A Food Auction on Zora Protocol and a Food Marketplace powered by the Graph Protocol are in progress. 
- Food NFTs are deployed on the Rainbow Bridge between Ethereum and NEAR Protocol. 

## What are the tools and technologies used :
- Ethereum, ERC 721, ERC 20, ERC 1620, ERC 1724
- Bonding Curves
- IPFS, Minty, Pinata, 
- Zora, Graph, NEAR Protocols
- Rainbow Bridge
- NodeJS, ReactJS

## Challenges we ran into
- Issues with the NodeJS Versions
- Issues with the Truffle Versions
- Issues with the Solidity Versions

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- First Ever Tokenisation of Street Foods on Ethereum
- First Ever Tokenisation of Family Foods on Ethereum
- First Ever Tokenisation of Eat Streets on Ethereum
- First Ever Tokenisation of Micro Social Business on Ethereum

## What we learned

## What's next for NalaNet
- Integration with Rarible
- Intergation with MetaVerse

## Deployment
- Nala Nation Primary Token
